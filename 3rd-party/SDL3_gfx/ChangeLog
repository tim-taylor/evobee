SDL3_gfx ChangeLog

Tue, Jan 28, 2025  07:40.00 PM
- version rev to 1.0.1
- Fixed bug and improvements (thanks DuilioPerez)
- Fixed testimagefilter log formatting (SDL_Log automatically inserts a newline in SDL3)
- Added more screenshots

Thr, Jan 16, 2025  03:35.00 PM
- Added cmake files to replace autotool/autoconf

- Renamed SDL2* files to SDL3*
- Changed references to SDL header from "SDL.h" to <SDL3/SDL.h>
- In SDL3_framerate.c, changed tick variables from Uint32 to Uint64 since SDL tick functions return a 64 bit value
- Updated msvc project to include a x64 target
- Update SDL3_gfxPrimitives functions to return bools instead of integers. This is the standard way SDL3 returns errors now.
- Renamed SDL2 function to their SDL3 equivalent. For example SDL_FreeSurface() was renamed SDL_DestroySurface() in SDL3.
- Palettes are now seperate from surfaces in SDL3. Added creation of palettes for indexed surfaces in SDL3_rotozoom
