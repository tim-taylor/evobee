# To build and use SDL_image:

SDL_image supports a number of development environments:
- [CMake](docs/INTRO-cmake.md)
- [Visual Studio on Windows](docs/INTRO-visualstudio.md)
- [Xcode on Apple platforms](docs/INTRO-xcode.md)
- [Android Studio](docs/INTRO-androidstudio.md)
- [Emscripten for web](docs/INTRO-emscripten.md)

SDL_image is also usable in other environments. The basic steps are to use CMake to build the library and then use the headers and library that you built in your project. You can search online to see if anyone has specific steps for your setup.

# Documentation

An API reference and additional documentation is available at:

https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_image

If you're using CMake, you can build them adding `-DSDLIMAGE_SAMPLES=ON` to the CMake command line when building SDL_image.

If you're using Visual Studio there are separate projects in the VisualC directory.

If you're using Xcode there are separate projects in the Xcode directory.
