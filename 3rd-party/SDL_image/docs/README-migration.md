# Migrating to SDL_image 3.0

This guide provides useful information for migrating applications from SDL_image 2.0 to SDL_image 3.0.

IMG_Init() and IMG_Quit() are no longer necessary. If an image format requires dynamically loading a support library, that will be done automatically.

IMG_GetError() has been replaced with SDL_GetError().

The functions named \*_RW() that previously took an SDL_RWops parameter have been renamed \*_IO() and take an SDL_IOStream parameter.

IMG_Linked_Version() has been replaced with IMG_Version().
